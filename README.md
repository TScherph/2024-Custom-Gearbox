# Custom-Gearbox
This projects major joints of the elbow, bicep, and shoulder, require a powerful motor and drive system. My solution for this is to create a 3d pritned cycloidal gearbox powered by a Nema 17 stepper motor.

This gearbox utilizes 4 3D printed gears and an ecceentric drive shaft that transmits the output of the nema motor to the box allowing for the 25:1 gear ratio to transmit its force further down the elbow.
